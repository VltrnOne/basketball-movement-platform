# Basketball Movement Intelligence Platform - UX Foundation

## 🎉 Success! Your UX Foundation is Built

Your Basketball Movement Intelligence Platform now has a complete, modern UI foundation based on your design brief.

## ✅ What I've Created

### 1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**
- Fully integrated with your brand colors
- Custom color palette: `brand-orange` (#FF7A00), `brand-dark` (#1a202c)
- Utility classes for success, warning, and danger states

### 2. **Core UI Components**
- **Button Component** (`src/components/ui/Button.tsx`): Reusable with variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost) and sizes
- **Card Component** (`src/components/ui/Card.tsx`): Flexible container with hover effects

### 3. **Main Application Layout**
- **AppLayout** (`src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`): Responsive sidebar navigation with:
  - Brand logo and navigation menu
  - User profile section
  - Main content area with header
  - Clean, modern dark theme

### 4. **Key Pages**
- **Dashboard** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`): Main hub featuring:
  - Gradient hero section with welcome message
  - Quick action cards for video upload and live analysis
  - Stats overview cards with key metrics
- **Login** (`src/pages/Login.tsx`): Clean authentication form with:
  - Branded header
  - Email/password inputs
  - Sign-in button and sign-up link

### 5. **Routing System**
- React Router setup with nested routes
- Main app routes (with sidebar) and standalone routes (login)
- Clean navigation structure
