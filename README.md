# Basketball Movement Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive platform for real-time and post-session analytics of basketball performance, featuring player tracking, penalty detection, fatigue monitoring, and detailed statistics.

## üèÄ Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Live video streaming with instant pose tracking and penalty detection
- **Video Upload**: Process recorded games with automated player detection and analytics
- **Player Statistics**: Detailed performance metrics including distance, speed, jumps, and fatigue
- **Penalty Detection**: AI-powered detection of traveling, double dribble, and other violations
- **Fatigue Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for player fatigue and injury prevention
- **Team Management**: Multi-player tracking with team and individual statistics

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your database:
   ```bash
   # Update DATABASE_URL in database.py with your PostgreSQL credentials
   # Then run the application
   python main.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for video upload, stats retrieval, and real-time data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence
- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8 for player detection, MMPose for pose estimation
- **Queue System**: Redis/Celery for asynchronous video processing

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Dashboard**: Overview of sessions, players, and key metrics
- **Video Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for video analysis
- **Live Analysis**: Real-time streaming with overlay statistics
- **Player Stats**: Detailed performance analytics and trends

## üìä Data Models

- **Users**: Coaches, players, and analysts with role-based access
- **Players**: Individual athlete profiles with physical attributes
- **Teams**: Team management with player assignments
- **Sessions**: Game/practice sessions with video and metadata
- **PlayerStats**: Time-series performance data
- **Penalties**: Detected violations with confidence scores

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://basketball_user:password@localhost:5432/basketball_db
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL and create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE basketball_db;
   CREATE USER basketball_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE basketball_db TO basketball_user;
   ```

2. Run the application to create tables automatically
